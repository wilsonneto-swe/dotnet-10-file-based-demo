# File Based Programs - .Net 10 New Features

File based programs is a new way we can run a .Net program directly from the .cs file, such as what we have in interpreted languages.

It is great for scripting and for those learning C#, as it make super simple to run C# code.

## Example

After installing .Net 10 SDK, just clone this repo and execute:

```bash
dotnet run ./passgen.cs
```

Or, a even simpler way:
```bash
./passgen.cs
```

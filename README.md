# File-Based Programs - .Net 10 New Features

File-based program is a new way to run a .Net program directly from a .cs file, similar to how interpreted languages work..

It is great for scripting and for those learning C#, as it makes running C# code extremely simple.

## Example

After installing the .Net 10 SDK, just clone this repo and execute:

```bash
dotnet run ./passgen.cs
```

Or, an even simpler way:

```bash
./passgen.cs
```
